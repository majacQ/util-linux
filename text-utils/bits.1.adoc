== NAME

bits - convert bit masks from/to various formats

== SYNOPSIS

*bits* [*-h*] [*-V*] [*-w* _<NUM>_] [_<MODE>_] [_<MASK_OR_LIST>_...]

== DESCRIPTION

The *bits* utility converts bit masks into various formats. It supports
combining multiple masks together using bitwise operations.

== POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

_<MASK_OR_LIST>_::
A set of bits specified as a hexadecimal mask value (e.g. _0xeec2_) or as
a comma-separated list of bit IDs.

If no argument is specified, the sets of bits will be read from standard input;
one group per line.

Consecutive ids can be compressed as ranges (e.g. _5,6,7,8,9,10_ -> _5-10_).

Optionally, if an argument starts with a comma, it will be parsed as a single
hexadecimal mask split in 32bit groups (e.g. _,00014000,00000000,00020000_ ->
_17,78,80_).

By default all groups will be OR'ed together. If a group has one of the
following prefixes, it will be combined with the resulting mask using
a different binary operation:

**&**__<MASK_OR_LIST>__::
The group will be combined with a binary AND operation. I.e. all bits that are
set to 1 in the group AND the combined groups so far will be preserved to 1.
All other bits will be reset to 0.

**^**__<MASK_OR_LIST>__::
The group will be combined with a binary XOR operation. I.e. all bits that are
set to 1 in the group AND to 0 the combined groups so far (or the other way
around) will be set to 1. Bits that are both to 1 or both to 0 will be reset to
0.

**~**__<MASK_OR_LIST>__::
All bits set to 1 in the group will be cleared (reset to 0) in the combined
groups so far.

== OPTIONS

include::man-common/help-version.adoc[]

*-w* __<NUM>__, *--width* __<NUM>__::
Maximum number of bits in the masks handled by *bits* (default __8192__). Any
bit larger than this number will be truncated.

== CONVERSION MODE

One of the following conversion modes can be specified. If not specified, it
defaults to *-m*, *--mask*.

*-m*, *--mask*::
Print the combined args as a hexadecimal mask value (default).

*-g*, *--grouped-mask*::
Print the combined args as a hexadecimal mask value in 32bit comma separated
groups.

*-b*, *--binary*::
Print the combined args as a binary mask value.

*-l*, *--list*::
Print the combined args as a list of bit IDs. Consecutive IDs are compressed as
ranges.
